Imagine how the graphpaper medium represents real life (full angular rotation/reference).

Imagine a top down map screen that you want to rotate the view around some point like
the character/protaganist.

This is sub optimal in square grid.
(Less so in say hex grid. (as illustration))

It can be mapped of course. Imagine a character facing some monster.
As the screen rotates the monster's square might be undisplayable.
ie. The monster would be too out of place in any possible square after rotation.

So now we are to the point.
The square to full coords mnapping is totally fine.
That happens in other ways all the time. 
Our minds do it.
So the monster-disappearing is like a ghost IRL.
This also has a quantum like breakdown.
For larger things (that take up multiple squares.) 
  ((or higher resol. where nothing is in just one square.))
 a monster would never "disappear".  There would always be some/enuf
squares displaying.

This could be a cool mechanic for roguelike....
